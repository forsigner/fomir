Schema is the most concept of **Fomir**.

## Shape of schema

```jsx
const schema = {
  onSubmit(values) {
    //..
  },
  components: {
    //...
  },

  children: [
    // nodes
    //...
  ],
}
```

The root node of schema is an object. it has a `children` property, `children` value is the node list.
